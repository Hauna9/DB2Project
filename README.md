# DB2Project
Project 1 for the Databases 2 Course GUC

Creating a simple DBMS with indexing using Java

Built a small database engine with support for Octrees Indices. 
The functionalities are 1) creating tables, 2) inserting tuples, 3) deleting tuples, 4) 
searching in tables linearly, 5) creating an Octree upon demand, and 6) using the created 
octree(s) where appropriate.
